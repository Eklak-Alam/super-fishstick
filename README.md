# 🧠 Gaprio  
## The Cognitive Layer for Enterprise Work

Gaprio is an AI-powered intelligence layer that sits above your existing tools and transforms fragmented workflows into coordinated, automated outcomes.

Instead of stitching tools together with fragile automations, Gaprio understands context across conversations, documents, and tasks — and turns everyday coordination into structured execution.

## 🚨 The Problem

Modern enterprises suffer from silent system degradation:

- ❌ **Data Silos** – Tools don’t talk to each other  
- ❌ **Context Loss** – Decisions live in chats, not systems  
- ❌ **Manual Overhead** – Managers spend hours aligning threads  
- ❌ **Security Blindspots** – Fragmented audit trails  
- ❌ **Disconnected AI** – AI tools operate inside single products  

Teams become the integration layer.

Gaprio eliminates that.

## 🧠 The Solution: A Shared Brain for Your Organization

Gaprio adds a unified intelligence layer across your entire stack.

It:

- Understands conversations, documents, and tasks together  
- Preserves institutional memory  
- Coordinates actions across tools  
- Executes workflows with human approval  
- Operates within your existing permission boundaries  

Gaprio does not replace your tools.  
It makes them work together intelligently.
